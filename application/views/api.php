                            <h2>What is API?</h2>
                            The API specifies how software components should interact and are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together. In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) specifies a software component in terms of its operations, their inputs and outputs and underlying types. Its main purpose is to define a set of functionalities that are independent of their respective implementation, allowing both definition and implementation to vary without compromising each other.

                            <h2>How API works?</h2>
                            We spent a lot of time on research the better flow of API and produce the better way for user to consume our API. Finally we 
                            find out a way to let the user easily consume our API easily. With the aid of the diagram below, user will be able to understand
                            the flow of the API and how it works. <br />

                        <p>
                            <h2>Why we provide API??</h2>
                            The reason why we created the API for developer to consume is because of prevent the user felt troublesome when collect the point after purchasing.
                            With the API, the user can straight away get the QR Code at the site their purchase. By having the API merchant and customer both will get the benefits. 
                            We belive this is the win-win strategy.
